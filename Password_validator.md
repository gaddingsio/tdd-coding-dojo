# Password validator

Another short one.

## What should it do?

Write a function "isValidPassword(String password)" that returns true if the following criteria are met:

* The password needs to have more than 8 characters
* At least 1 number
* At least 1 uppercase letter
* at least 1 lowercase letter
* at least 1 of the following special characters: _$@#+-

**Remember to start with baby steps and a failing test before adding any real code!**
