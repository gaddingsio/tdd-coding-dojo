# tdd-coding-dojo
Collection of excercises for my [TDD-Coding Dojo](https://gaddings.io/coding-dojo-for-tdd/)


* [FizzBuzz](FizzBuzz.md)
* [Password validator](Password_validator.md)
* [Vending machine](Vending_machine.md)

You can also create your own scenarios easily. Just make sure that they are well-defined and don't leave much room for interpretation.
Also bigger things like a simple CRUD service are possible.

Have fun!
